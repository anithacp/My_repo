First of all, note you are not using the variable correctly:

if [ "pass_tc11" != "" ]; then
      ^
      missing $

Anyway, to check if a variable is empty or not you can use -z --> the string is empty:

if [ ! -z "$pass_tc11" ]; then
   echo "hi"
fi

or -n --> the length is non-zero:

if [ -n "$pass_tc11" ]; then
   echo "hi"
fi

From man test:

    -z STRING

    the length of STRING is zero

    -n STRING

    the length of STRING is nonzero

Samples:

$ [ ! -z "$var" ] && echo "yes"
$

$ var=""
$ [ ! -z "$var" ] && echo "yes"
$

$ var="a"
$ [ ! -z "$var" ] && echo "yes"
yes

$ var="a"
$ [ -n "$var" ] && echo "yes"
yes

returning value from called function in shell script

Here's how to do each of those options:
1. echo strings

lockdir="somedir"
testlock(){
    retval=""
    if mkdir "$lockdir"
    then # directory did not exist, but was created successfully
         echo >&2 "successfully acquired lock: $lockdir"
         retval="true"
    else
         echo >&2 "cannot acquire lock, giving up on $lockdir"
         retval="false"
    fi
    echo "$retval"
}

retval=$( testlock )
if [ "$retval" == "true" ]
then
     echo "directory not created"
else
     echo "directory already created"
fi 

2. return exit status

lockdir="somedir"
testlock(){
    if mkdir "$lockdir"
    then # directory did not exist, but was created successfully
         echo >&2 "successfully acquired lock: $lockdir"
         retval=0
    else
         echo >&2 "cannot acquire lock, giving up on $lockdir"
         retval=1
    fi
    return "$retval"
}

testlock
retval=$?
if [ "$retval" == 0 ]
then
     echo "directory not created"
else
     echo "directory already created"
fi 

3. share variable

lockdir="somedir"
retval=-1
testlock(){
    if mkdir "$lockdir"
    then # directory did not exist, but was created successfully
         echo >&2 "successfully acquired lock: $lockdir"
         retval=0
    else
         echo >&2 "cannot acquire lock, giving up on $lockdir"
         retval=1
    fi
}

testlock
if [ "$retval" == 0 ]
then
     echo "directory not created"
else
     echo "directory already created"
fi
